[[https://flutter.dev/][Flutter]] requires you to mark this directory as safe in order to
function properly.
#+begin_src conf
  [safe]
      directory = /opt/flutter
#+end_src

Configures git to use =git-credential-libsecret= as the credential
helper. This allows it to use the [[https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Libsecret][libsecret]] API to store and retrieve
passwords, which allows for encrypted storage of HTTPS credentials
using the [[https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeKeyring][GNOME Keyring]] (or some other keyring).

The [[https://archlinux.org/packages/core/x86_64/libsecret/][libsecret]] and [[https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/gnome-keyring/][gnome-keyring]] packages need to be installed for this
to work.
